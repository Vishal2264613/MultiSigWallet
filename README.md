## Introduction

The MultisigWallet smart contract allows for the secure management of funds by requiring multiple signatures to approve transactions. This setup is ideal for organizations or groups needing collective authorization for financial actions. 

## Features

- **Multiple Signatures**: Requires a specified number of signatures from a group of owners to execute transactions.
- **Add/Remove Owners**: Manage the list of authorized signers.
- **Change Required Signatures**: Update the number of required signatures for a transaction.
- **Execute Transactions**: Propose, approve, and execute transactions.
- **Event Logging**: Emits events for transactions, approvals, and ownership changes.

## Requirements

- **Solidity Version**: Compatible with Solidity version ^0.8.0.
- **Ethereum Network**: Ethereum mainnet, testnets (e.g., Ropsten, Rinkeby), or local Ethereum networks (e.g., Ganache).

## Deployment

To deploy your contract to a live network, configure your deployment script with the desired network settings and execute the deployment command.

1. Copy & paste the code in Remix IDE.
2. Compile and deploy it.
3. Start using the functions it contains.
